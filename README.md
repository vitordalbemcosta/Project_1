Save Programming Shooting Game

Coding game built from scratch with plain JavaScript for DOM manipulation. Js canvas was used to build the shooting game. The game has a losing and winning logic that depends on the players performance.

This is my Project #1 from full stack web development course at Iron Hack Lisbon class of January 2022.
